** Warning this was mainly Gemini AI generated, just with me curtailing certain aspects

Code is released as MIT, feel free to use and abuse said project which is mainly AI generated anyway.

If you rather not build the application, the .exe file is located in the DirToXml folder.

I haven't written a console app in a while, so this may not be the prettiest, but is just something difference
